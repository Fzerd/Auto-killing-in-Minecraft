 Automatically shoot down falling monsters with arrows in the dungeon.
 20190703 update informations:
   I have got almost all the critical codes done in the past several days!
   And, I've tried my codes on my desk, whose rusults proved that those words
   could imitate the mouse to transfer right-click to my computer, which may
   be used on pulling the bow.
   Also, using the prtscreen-and-contrast ways, the codes can tell the changes 
   in screen, so that we can change the model when some monsters (such as CREEPERs)
   fall down on the Hopper.
   The whole codes has been specified enable on desk, so it's time to try them in Minecraft.
   However, all the things changed, although my program run well in the background, my role had never
   pulled the bow at all. Which is to say, my mouse-imitation could'nt work in the game. I wander
   if the reason hides in the coordinate mapping process, or I have to initate my mouse on physical layer?
   I was confused and wish to get help.
